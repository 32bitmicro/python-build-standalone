There is support for producing 64-bit CPython distributions for Windows,
macOS, and Linux. All distributions are highly self-contained and have
limited shared library dependencies.

Planned and features include:

* Static/dynamic linking toggles for dependencies
* Support for configuring which toolchain/version to use
* Support for BSDs
* Support for iOS and/or Android
* Support for Python distributions that aren't CPython
