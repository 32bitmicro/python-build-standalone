# This file defines metadata for Python extension modules.
#
# Keys are the name of an extension module in a CPython distribution.
# Values are maps having the following keys:
#
# disabled-targets
#   Array of targets the extension module is disabled on. Values are regular
#   expressions.
#
# minimum-python-version
#   X.Y version number of minimum Python containing this extension module.
#
# required-targets
#   Array of target triples this extension module is required to initialize
#   a Python interpreter.

_testcapi:
  # Ideally this would only be disabled while cross-compiling. We can't build it
  # as a built-in extension via static-modules. And when letting setup.py build
  # it, it builds for the host architecture during cross-builds, which upsets
  # our validation script when it screens for the target machine type of
  # binaries. So just disable it.

    # Missing header dependencies on musl.
    - .*-unknown-linux-musl

    # On other UNIX platforms, it is globally disabled because it has a dependency
    # on libnsl, which isn't part of the Linux Standard Base specification. libnsl
    # has a wonky history where it was once part of glibc and core system installs
    # but is slowly being phased away from base installations. There are potential
    # workarounds to adding nis support. See discussion in
    # https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/51.
